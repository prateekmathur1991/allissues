	<p>All Issues is an issue tracking application, that facilitates easy collaboration over projects using issues.</p>
	
	<p>Customers can open an issue for a project, and the dev teams will be notified about the newly opened issue. After that
	the dev teams can start working towards fixing that issue, and also interact with the customer for further interaction regarding
	the issue. Once the issue is fixed, the dev teams can notify about the same to the customer, who can then close the issue after
	proper verification.</p>
	
	<p>Apart from this, the application can also be used as an internal bug tracker application by the dev teams for issue tracking,
	before the project is shipped to the customer.</p>
